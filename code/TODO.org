* DONE Reformat data for LIBSVM
  - using preprocess-data-libsvm.py
* DONE Rank features [4/4]
  - [X] Write a read_data_2_matrix function to read from features file (that
    doesn't contain the labels) directly to a matrix -- written in
    filter_util.py
  - [X] Pearson Correlation Coefficient
  - [X] Signal-to-Noise Ratio
  - [X] T-test
* TODO Scale data
  - using LIBSVM itself
  - not sure if we need to scale the data as we have already normalized it.
* DONE Output data in a file
  - Write a function to do this
* DONE Create Data files for different number of N
* TODO Test SVM
* TODO Reformat and Preprocess for scikitlearn nearest neighbor
* TODO Test kNN
